@ASKS:

# Q1?
# Why not use async and await here? A: in the update of the package they use async and await alternate then 

# .custom((categoryId) => {
#   const category = CategoriesModel.findById(categoryId);
#   if (!category)
#     return Promise.reject(
#       new Error(`No Category with this id: ${categoryId}`)
#     );
# }),

# Q2?
# Why is a category created by this code not similar to the product? A: we update it with API features after some videos

# const postSubCategory = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
#   const { name, category } = req.body;
#   const subCategory = await SubCategoriesModel.create({
#     name,
#     slug: slugify(name),
#     category,
#   });
#   res.status(201).json({ data: subCategory });
# });

# Q3?
# Is the best practice that creates this code in the validator layer or not? yes he makes it after some videos
# From:
#   const { id } = req.params;
#   if (req.body.title) {
#     req.body.slug = slugify(req.body.title);
#   }
# To:
#   .custom((name, { req }) => {
#     req.body.slug = slugify(name);
#     return true;
#   }

Q4?
why do we use handlersFactory.js to contain separated functions, not a class containing all these functions ex ApiFeatures?

Q5?
should write validate for an image in the validation layer or No?

check("image").isString().optional(),

Q6?
when case error, the image is saved on the file system however it does not save on db
because "---ProcessingMiddleware" put before "---Valitatior" & controllers ex: "post--"
what is solving this problem?

Q7?
when I should update "name", should update for slug automatically? I think yes

Q8?
why custom validation for check email is founded in Database (unique email)?
I think to return this message"This Email already registered"
# but we did not add custom validation for name and title in other Models?

Q9?
I see people use "const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(12);" before "const passHashed = await bcrypt.hash(req.body.password, salt);"
which is better?

Q10?
why in updateOneUser.js in userFactory?
-Don't use:

    const bodyClone = { ...req.body };
    delete bodyClone.password;

-alternate to:
  { name : "Ahmed",
    email: "afd@gmail.con",
    phone: "01025896314",
    role : "user", ...}

Q11?

# why don't we use "updatedAt" to alternate create a new field and use "passwordChangedAt"?
#     "updatedAt": "2023-06-05T01:30:50.720Z",
#     "__v": 0,
#     "passwordChangedAt": "2023-06-05T01:30:50.718Z"

# because we need when password change update only when any fields update

Q12) why we do not generate new a token when updating the user password by Admin or make a free choice to admin to update or not?
Q13) Why don't I delete these fields before returning it to a user
    "password": "$2b$12$xmL73UiFWT5pxq95q0zrvOnAekCDbfiD1H1fWF1ZEe0E.WveTFBM2",
    "active": true,
    "createdAt": "2023-06-06T06:35:12.250Z",
    "updatedAt": "2023-06-08T01:37:08.043Z",
    "__v": 0,
    "passwordChangedAt": "2023-06-08T01:37:08.041Z"

Q14) Why when making validation on the route: "mechangepassword" make the error msg: "jwt malformed" name: "JsonWebTokenError" but when add token in header in postman, it work correctly

@Notes:
  ** "cross-env" ==> for making "start: prod": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production node app.js" work on window
  # ** UpdateRuleValidator does not create in this course (ok)
  ** Update check name found before "slug" in other Controller
  ** Search for know, how flat many objects are on one array
  # ** he doesn't add "filterObject" to find after replacing code with "apiFeatures"
  ** In most update routes in current applications in jobs make a route for updating all fields except password and make another route for updating password only.
  ** solve add a Gmail to node mailer
  ** `User changed password, please login again`  in protect in auth_C.js suggest change to "Password is changed, please login again" because may the admin who change the password

@Do not forget:
# 1- Update slug and slugify and validator layer in category Controller after the image section because can update more than one field. (ok)
2- Don't forget to write the check if the required "categoriesids" repeated on create validation and update validation or no line 84
3- when I should update "name", should update for slug automatically
4- create a route for deleting the token in the client when the token is in the cookies
5- add a validation layer for forgetting passwords to check email is correct and not empty (ok)
6- add a validation layer for updating new passwords after reset (ok)
7-// hint from me: I should if passwordResetCodeExpiration end add in auth_C.js in verifyResetCode function
  // user.passwordResetCode = undefined;
  // user.passwordResetCodeExpiration = undefined;
  // user.passwordResetCodeIsVerified = undefined;
